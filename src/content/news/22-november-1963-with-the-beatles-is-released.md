The band's second album was released on 22 November 1963 – a date historically remembered for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas.

While the majority of their debut album had been completed in a single, long session, The Beatles had to record their second release in-between concert tours, numerous radio and TV performances (including the prestigious Sunday Night At The London Palladium) and their first international tour to Sweden.

It was around this time that the term "Beatlemania" was first coined.

The album would reach No. 1 in the UK Record Retailer chart just a couple weeks later.
